# Identifying frames in social media text
Social media posts (tweets, facebook posts) often have a hidden underlying bias. Because of this bias, the same topic is potrayed in different lights (positive, negative or neutral). Identifying this hidden bias, commonly known as framing in natural processing tasks is a challenging task. In this project, we examine how a linear classifier such as logistic regression performs compared to a neural network in identifying frames in twitter discourse.
